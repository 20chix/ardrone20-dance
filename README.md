Warning! The authors disclaim any responsibility for any damage when code running with drone :)

*Unfortunately, the authors do not have enough time to work on the project. We will be glad if someone realizes positioning using computer vision (like aruco, SLAM). Positioning with accelerometers have large error and is not suitable for pure flight.*
